# Project-1 Group 9: Sewit Eskinder, Audrey Fermanich, Jason Burke, Ashwin Udupa

Contained within this repository are the graphic visualizations of group 9 as well as their individual Jupyter Notebooks containing the individual code necessary to articulate our research. This readme has the aggregate findings of group 9's project 1.


Using Kaggle our team identified a dataset (Top 200 Spotify Charts 2020-2021) that we found both interesting and containing enough numerical/statistical information for us to infer analytical queries and implications while making meaningful deductions to support our presentation. 

The parameters we set out to achieve are as follows:

1. Each member selected an artist found in the dataset.
  a. Sewit – Doja Cat
  b. Audrey – The Weeknd
  c. Jason – Ed Sheeran
  d. Ashwin – Drake
  
2. What are the total Number of followers for each selected artist?
3. What are the total number of songs each artist has had in the top 200 and did the artist get #1 charting position?
4. What were the total number of streams per song? Then aggregate the complete total number of streams and display a bar graph for total number of streams per song.

5. Utilizing an overall data comparison we established the following:
  a. Which artist had the most amount of streams, and then we visualized this with a pie chart and a horizontal bar graph for the individual artists selected.
  b. Total number of times each individual artist has charted compared to one another and then displayed via bar graph and ejected pie chart (ejecting the lowest            charting artist)
  c. Which artist has the highest and lowest number of followers and then displayed via scatter plot.

Summary Analysis:
     This project (and the supporting files contained herein) establish our understanding of the concepts we have learned thus far in the course (Aggregation,                correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis), with our visualizations further enforcing our comprehensions.
